# -Decision-Tree-Based-Parkinsons-Disease-Diagnosis-A-Mobile-First-Approach
🔹 Project Overview

Designed and implemented a machine learning–based diagnostic system to support the early detection of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). The project leverages decision tree classifiers and comparative ML models to analyze patient datasets, focusing on both motor and non-motor symptoms. A mobile-first web application (Streamlit) was developed for accessibility, enabling patients and healthcare professionals to use the tool across devices.

🔹 Objectives

Provide an early diagnosis mechanism for PD to allow timely medical intervention.
Build a user-friendly mobile application for doctors, caregivers, and patients.
Ensure the system is interpretable and explainable through feature importance analysis.

🔹 Key Contributions

✅ Conducted literature review and identified gaps in existing diagnostic approaches.
✅ Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed voice and clinical datasets.
✅ Implemented and compared decision trees, random forests, boosting algorithms, and ensemble methods for classification.
✅ Achieved 96.45% average accuracy, outperforming other baseline models.
✅ Built an interactive web and mobile platform using Streamlit, offering real-time predictions.
✅ Designed visualizations for feature analysis and interpretability.
✅ Applied rigorous testing to ensure system reliability.

🔹 Impact

Developed a low-cost, scalable AI solution for Parkinson’s disease screening.
Enhanced accessibility with a mobile-first interface, making healthcare technology usable beyond clinical settings.
Provided explainable ML insights, supporting doctors in understanding diagnostic factors.
Contributed to healthcare innovation and preventive medicine by enabling early intervention strategies.
